# Vimeo Scraper

Scrape and download all Vimeo videos for a user. Written in Python.

Yes Vimeo has an API. This doesn't need an API key, it's cooler.

Ok. I'm just practicing Python.

## Usage

```bash
python vimeo_scrape.py user_name
```

This fills the `videos` directory with all of `user_name`'s videos.
